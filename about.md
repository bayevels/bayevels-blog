Hey my name is _Serigne Mouhamadou Bassirou Diaby_ but you can call me **Bashir** or _Bayevels_. I'm a [**Flou**](https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/flou) Stack engineer living in Dakar, Senegal.  

## Day to Day Life
I spent most of my days 
* writing **Ruby**, **Javascript**, **Java**, **Kotlin** and **Typescript** code for senegalese and french compagnies as a freelancer
* Scrolling trought my twitter feed [@bayevels](https://twitter.com/bayevels)
* reading physics, economics and history books (I read a lot)
* Write open source software on GitHub [@bayevels](https://github.com/bayevels)

## I enjoy working on
* Ruby on Rails projects (I just enjoy working with Ruby and RoR is the jerry on top), I fell in love with ruby on the first day we meet.
  ```ruby
  # Return True if the submission can be affected
  def status_not_updatable?
    (validated? || rejected? || obsolete? || !session.definitely_closed? ||
      !user.session_limit_reached?(session) || user.submission_accepted?(session))
  end
  ```
* Android projects using Kotlin (kotlin saved me from the tyranny of J* V *)
* Vue JS project using Typescript and/or Javascript (to be honest I prefer when it's TS)
